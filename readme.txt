With this lightweight plugin you can add a meta description to your website.


== Description ==
= About =
With this lightweight plugin you can add a meta description to your website.

The meta description summarizes the content of a post or page.

Search engines such as Google and Bing will use the meta description when displaying search results.

Add a meta description only for your homepage, or for each individual post and page.

This plugin also supports WooCommerce products, product categories and tags.

= How to use =
After installation go to the settings page. This page is located at Settings > Meta description.

More info about using this plugin is displayed there as well.

= Have a question? =
Please take a look at the FAQ section.

= Translation =
Translations are not included, but the plugin supports WordPress language packs.

More [translations](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/very-simple-meta-description) are very welcome!

The translation folder inside this plugin is redundant, but kept for reference.

= Credits =
Without help and support from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so thank you!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I set plugin language? =
The plugin will use the website language, set in Settings > General.

If translations are not available in the selected language, English will be used.

= How is the meta description added to my website? =
The meta description will be added to the head section of your website.

= Why does this plugin recommend a certain meta description length? =
Because search engines such as Google and Bing recommend a meta description length roughly between 120 and 160 characters.

If your meta description is too short it may be ignored in favour of one that is generated by the search engine.

And if your meta description is too long it may be cut off.

= Why does a search engine ignore my meta description? =
After adding or changing a meta description it can take up to several weeks before search engines such as Google and Bing have indexed your website again.

But a search engine can also decide not to use it, if your meta description does not match the requirements.

= Why no excerpt box in the editor? =
When using the block editor, click the options icon and select "Preferences".

When using the classic editor, click the "Screen Options" tab.

Probably the checkbox to display the relevant box in the editor is not checked.

= Why no product section on settings page? =
This section is only available if WooCommerce is installed and active.

= Can I use this plugin with other SEO plugins? =
If you have an active plugin (or theme) that also contains a meta description feature, don't activate or use this feature.

= Why is there no semantic versioning? =
The version number won't give you info about the type of update (major, minor, patch). You should check the changelog to see whether or not the update is a major or minor one.

= How can I make a donation? =
You like my plugin and want to make a donation? There's a PayPal donate link at my website. Thank you!

= Other questions or comments? =
Please open a topic in the WordPress.org support forum for this plugin.
